                      "description": "This diagram shows the orbit of binary asteroid Didymos around the Sun. Didymos consists of a large, nearly half-mile-wide (780-meter-wide) asteroid orbited by a smaller, 525-foot-wide (160-meter-wide) asteroid, or moonlet. Didymos' orbital path around the Sun is shown as the thin white ellipse and Earth's orbit is the thick white line. In the background are the orbits for 2,200 other known potentially hazardous asteroids.  A potentially hazardous asteroid is classified as an asteroid wider than about 460 feet (140 meters) with an orbit that brings it within 5 million miles (8 million kilometers) of Earth's orbit.  Didymos' smaller asteroid is the target of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) mission. The DART spacecraft is a kinetic impactor designed to collide with the moonlet to see how its orbit around the larger asteroid will be changed by the impact. The outcome of this mission will help NASA determine whether the method could be used to modify the trajectory of an asteroid should one threaten Earth in the future. Didymos is not a danger to our planet.  This orbital diagram was produced by the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), which is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. CNEOS characterizes every known near-Earth asteroid (NEA) orbit to improve long-term impact hazard assessments in support of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO).  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24565"

                      "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 215, “Redirecting Asteroids.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Chances are, you might have seen a doomsday movie in the past, where an asteroid comes crashing into the modern Earth with devastating effects. Certainly not an unfounded idea; happened to the dinosaurs. But you've probably wondered what can we do to protect the planet from something like this? Enter NASA's DART mission, D-A-R-T, stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test. It's a planetary defense test mission, meaning we're going to try out some technologies and capabilities on a binary asteroid system that's not really a threat to the Earth but will act as a good proving ground to learn how to redirect potentially hazardous asteroids. So joining us is Dr. Thomas Statler, DART's program scientist based at NASA’s Headquarters in Washington. Tom discusses more details into the overall mission and technologies, like smart navigation, rollout solar arrays, and xenon thrusters that will be used on the mission. Exciting stuff. So, let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Tom Statler, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Thomas Statler: Hey, thanks, Gary. It's great to be here talking about DART. We're going to make sure that a rock from space doesn't send us back to the Stone Age.  Host: [Laughter] That's a pretty important mission for you, Tom. I want to understand a little bit about what it takes to put a person like you in a position like this, really, you know, we can say protecting our planet, right? So, some of your earlier works is very interesting, and I think it builds very nicely to your work with asteroids that gets you to start working with DART, which is, of course, with an asteroid. So, take us through some of the things that got you to where you are today, Tom.  Thomas Statler: Oh, boy. Well, that takes me back a long way. I mean, basically, well, you know, as a little kid, there were two things that I thought were just unbelievably cool, and one was galaxies. And I looked at, you know, saw the pictures of spiral galaxies in books and I thought, how amazing that is that something that unimaginably vast can be that beautiful? And the other thing was the idea that we could actually go to other planets, because I was a kid of the Space Age, I was just old enough to understand what was going on. I remember the Apollo 11 landing distinctly. I was old enough to know that it was cool but not old enough to know how dangerous it was. And so, so I really had kind of two, two dream jobs as a kid. One was to be an astronomer and uncover the secrets of the universe. And I did that: I majored in physics and astronomy, I went through the academic ranks, and I became a professor. But now, I have this other dream job which is helping to send robot spacecraft to other planets and asteroids.  Host: Wonderful. So why don't we get into the mission itself? We're going to start talking about this mission, DART, Double Asteroid Redirect Mission. So, if you had to talk to someone off the street and they said, hey, Tom, what's DART, how would you start?  Thomas Statler: Well, DART is our first full-scale attempt to demonstrate that we can change the motion of an asteroid in space, potentially as a way of defending Earth against the hazard of asteroid impacts. And to understand this, it's good to have, you know, the right mental conceptual movie going on in your head. So, to start with, you know, the Earth goes around the Sun. Earth orbits around the sun in, in one year. The other planets also orbit the Sun, and all of the asteroids also orbit the Sun. And that means that any asteroid that is on an orbit around the Sun that never comes anywhere close to the orbit of the Earth isn't dangerous. The only asteroids that are possibly hazardous are the ones that have orbits that intersect with the orbit of the Earth somewhere. And even then, nothing bad happens unless the Earth and the asteroid try to arrive at that intersection point at the same time. And that's when you can have an asteroid impact on Earth. And that's really pointing to the essence of what we call planetary defense, defending Earth against this natural hazard. The key is to be able to find the asteroids on those Earth-intersecting trajectories, find them well in advance of any collision, and to take steps years ahead of time, not to destroy the asteroid -- don't need to do that; in many cases, we wouldn't be able to -- but just to prevent that collision from happening. And that's what we're going to do with DART. We're going to demonstrate one technology to cause that deflection that, someday, if we need to, we might use this technology to prevent an asteroid from hitting the Earth.  Host: So, the mission that we’re going, the mission and the asteroid that we're going to, is not necessarily the asteroid that's going to cause that devastating effect on Earth. It's really a test to make sure that we have the capabilities for that asteroid in the future, if there is one, that would have such effects.  Thomas Statler: That's exactly right. There's no known asteroid that has any chance of impacting the Earth anytime in the next hundred years. So, the hazard is not from the asteroids we know, and the asteroid that we're going to with DART is not a dangerous asteroid. The hazard is from the, from the asteroids that we haven't discovered yet. And we're searching for asteroids all the time. We certainly hope that we will never have to deploy an asteroid deflector, but we want to do the test now to make sure that we've got the ability and the know-how to do it if we should need to.  Host: Very good. But what are some of the assets, what are some of the things that we have in place, to watch what's going on in the solar system around us and make sure we're OK?  Thomas Statler: Well, the key thing for asteroids is telescopes. You need telescopes to essentially scan the skies, take a lot of pictures of the sky with a wide-field view, and look for things that are moving. The stars don't move; they're in the far, far distant background. But objects that are moving in the solar system, especially ones that are moving close to Earth, will move over the course of the night, and if you take a couple of pictures of the same patch of sky, you'll see them move. And that’s, historically, that's how asteroids have been discovered from the beginning. So, we use a variety of telescopes in various places around the world. We've got projects that are operated by universities, funded by NASA, some of them funded by other space agencies, other governments around the world. All work together to, as I said, scan the sky, look for objects that are moving, track those objects, send those data to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center, which is funded by NASA, that will calculate the orbits and determine whether each of these things that are just seen moving across the sky at night, is it an asteroid, what kind of an orbit is it in, and is it in an Earth-crossing or Earth-intersecting trajectory? And that happens every night, 365 days a year.  Host: Excellent. So, what about the destination of DART then? What is special about this asteroid that is the final destination of the DART mission?  Thomas Statler: Well, DART is going to a very, very cool asteroid. In fact, it's two asteroids. It's the system, the binary asteroid system called Didymos. And a binary, people may have heard of binary stars, where you have one star orbiting around another; a binary asteroid is like that too. There's a larger asteroid and then there's a little asteroid held in orbit by the very weak gravity of the larger asteroid, and it goes around it. So Didymos is a binary asteroid. The larger one, that's called Didymos, is about 800 meters across or so. The smaller moon is called Dimorphos. It's about 150 meters across or so, so kind of football stadium-sized. And the two of them are about three-quarters of a mile apart, about a kilometer and a little bit.  Host: OK.  Thomas Statler: So, well, I live near Washington, D.C., so I think of things in terms of the map around here. But if you've been to the National Mall, where the Smithsonian museums are, if you can imagine that, those pair of asteroids, if you put them down on the National Mall, they would fit between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument with room to spare. It's a surprisingly small and compact little asteroid system. So, DART's going to go to this asteroid system and execute a kinetic impact on the small moonlet Dimorphos. And kinetic impact is a technical term for running into the thing, because that's what kinetic impact is. OK. So, here's the visual for you, OK? So Dimorphos, the little asteroid moonlet, is basically a small football stadium filled with rocks. So, get your high school football stadium, fill it up with rocks, that's your model for the asteroid. The DART spacecraft is kind of a golf cart filled with computers and cameras and stuff. About that size. It has big solar panels on it, but they don't weigh very much. And then, basically, what we're doing with DART is you take your golf cart full of cameras, you get it going up to 15,000 miles an hour, and you run it into the side of your football stadium full of rocks. That's what we're doing with, with DART. Now, go ahead and ask me why in the world are we doing that?  Host: I'm going to go ahead and do that, Tom. Why are we doing that?  Thomas Statler: Because that's the kinetic impact and that is the deflection mechanism. We are using that collision to impart a bunch of momentum to the big asteroid. By hitting it with a small thing at high velocity, we're delivering a lot of momentum to change its motion. And the reason we're doing this in this binary asteroid system is that when we impact the moonlet and change its motion, that makes a change to the orbit of the moonlet Dimorphos around Didymos. That's really key. And that's why the binary asteroid is a perfect natural laboratory to do this experiment in. Because the part that I didn't tell you is that the reason we know this is a binary asteroid is we can observe it from Earth. Now, even in a big telescope, you can't see that it's two asteroids; all you can see is the combined light of one asteroid. But if you monitor the brightness of that asteroid that's shining by the reflected light of the Sun, you'll see that, every so often, like clockwork, the brightness dims just a little bit and then comes back up. And what's going on is that the moonlet is either going behind or going in front of [Didymos], and a little bit of the light gets blocked when it goes in front or behind. And because we've got years of those observations, we know that that moonlet is there, and we know that it goes around Didymos like clockwork every 11 hours and 55 minutes. So, we see that little dip in the light every, maybe, you might not see it every time around, maybe every half time around. At any rate, we see those dips in the light as one goes behind the other every orbit. What we're going to do with DART, by executing the kinetic impact, we change that orbit so that what was 11 hours and 55 minutes might end up being 11 hours and maybe 50 minutes. And by measuring, by watching those eclipses happen in the weeks and months after our kinetic impact, we're going to see the clock is running a little bit faster than it was before. And that's the thing that's going to enable us to measure, extremely accurately, exactly what the kinetic impact did to the asteroid. Because DART, you know, it's called Double Asteroid Redirection Test, which I think is the coolest name ever, because we're doing the test on a double asteroid, there's the binary asteroid, but it's also a double test. It's two tests in one. We're testing our technological ability to actually execute the kinetic impact, to actually collide with an asteroid, but we're also testing how does a real asteroid react to that kinetic impact. Because anybody can take a couple of hundred million dollars' worth of spacecraft and smash it to bits, but the real question is, did we move the asteroid or not and by how much?  Host: So, if I'm imagining what you just painted for me, Tom, correctly, it sounds like you are going to crash into the moonlet Dimorphos with the orbit, thus speeding up the orbit just, just a tad, right? And what that's going to do is, what's your hypothesis, in terms of setting it off course or something, setting the whole binary system off course?  Thomas Statler: Well, we're not trying to set it all off course.  Host: Oh, interesting.  Thomas Statler: Let's take it a piece at a time. So, first of all, I got to tell you a little bit about how orbits work. They, they go not the direction you expect. So, actually, what we're intending to do, and this could change depending on the details and the circumstances exactly when we launch and exactly when we get there, but we're intending on hitting the moonlet asteroid head-on --   Host: Oh, interesting.   Thomas Statler: -- which momentarily slows it down, but what that does is it drops it into a slightly tighter orbit around the primary body, which takes less time to go around. So, the period gets less. So, it's this counterintuitive thing. One of the great dynamicists, dynamical theoretical astrophysicists who had a lot of work on galaxies, which a lot of influence on galaxy work, which I used to do, Donald Lynden-Bell, he used to say, orbits are like donkeys, you pull them one way and they go the other way. So that's an aspect of this. You hit the thing to slow it down and it ends up going around faster.  Host: Yeah, you're right. It’s not, it’s not, to me, like, I would think, OK, we want to speed it up, so let's give it a little nudge. That's not what's happening here. You're essentially putting it into a lower orbit, and that's what makes the orbit slightly faster.  Thomas Statler: Exactly.  Host: OK.  Thomas Statler: And, and people familiar, as your podcast audience is, people who are familiar with human spaceflight know this, because you know if you're in low-Earth orbit and you want to reenter and want to come back down, you fire your retro rockets to slow down and drop to a lower orbit, where the atmosphere then grabs you.  Host: OK. OK. Now I think what's impressive, Tom is, so you're talking about there's an asteroid flying somewhere in the solar system and you have to predict not only where it's going to be, so that the DART spacecraft can impact something that's orbiting it, but you have to estimate the orbit of the moonlet itself so you can meet your target. Is that right?  Thomas Statler: Absolutely right. We have to get there at the right moment, when not just the whole asteroid system is at the spot that we delivered the spacecraft to, but the asteroid moonlet is in the right part of its orbit that we actually succeed in executing the kinetic impact on it when we wanted to in the head-on direction. And that is the product of a lot of work with ground-based telescopes that the astronomers on the DART team have been doing for several years now to observe, as I was talking about before, these transits and eclipses, the places where the light dims just momentarily, to observe those over and over and over again. And the more observations of those events that you get, the more accurately you can pin down exactly the length of the orbit. And so there were key observations that were just done this past winter that were absolutely essential in order to be able to predict at what time the moonlet Dimorphos is going to be at the right phase of the orbit so that we can, we can strike it with the, with the spacecraft. So those observations have been going on for years, establishing the properties of that orbit now. And if you think about it, we have to do that because the whole essence of the test is comparing before versus after. And so, you've got to do the observations before to pin down what the “before” state is because you don't get to go back and do it again after you've done the kinetic impact.  Host: I see. OK. So, so for the binary system, where is it approximately now, and where do you expect it to be with all the measurements that you've just talked about at the time that you want DART to make the kinetic impact?  Thomas Statler: OK. So, the system Didymos is in orbit around the Sun. It's on an orbit that at its, it’s an elliptical orbit, and so at its closest point to the Sun it's pretty close to the Earth, it's about Earth's distance from the Sun, and at its farthest point it's just edging out into the main asteroid belt beyond Mars. But it's probably about two and a half astronomical units from the Sun right now. When we arrive there with the DART spacecraft, and this was intentionally done this way, it's going to be only about 0.072 astronomical units away from the Earth. I can't do the math in my head quite that much, but an astronomical unit is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, it's 150 million kilometers, so multiply that by 0.072, and that's how close we're going to be. And we're timing the kinetic impact for that moment so that we can have really efficient communication and high bandwidth back because, of course, on this mission, so, many of our recent missions, like, for example, people are aware of New Horizons that flew by Pluto a few years ago, two years ago, gave us our first view of Arrokoth, that fantastic Kuiper Belt object. New Horizons is built to take a lot of data, acquire a lot of images really fast, and then, later on, send it back to Earth bit by bit. On DART, we don't have the luxury to do that because after we arrive at, you know, Didymos, there's no spacecraft left after that. So, we're streaming back video in real-time as fast as we possibly can. And having that high bandwidth, short-distance communication is going to be really important.  Host: OK. So, you're planning on getting imagery, or may possibly even video back at the final moments before the kinetic impact?  Thomas Statler: Not quite video.  Host: OK.  Thomas Statler: We're expecting a frame rate of about one per second. But this is the key to the mission. We've got, on the spacecraft, which is about the size of a big vending machine roughly, it's not very large, it only weighs about half a ton. And we've got one instrument on it, which is a great camera called DRACO (Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation). And Draco is actually modeled after the LORRI (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) camera that is flying on New Horizons right now. So, DRACO just looks out the front at where it's going and, and identifies Dimorphos, Didymos/Dimorphos asteroid system, picks out Dimorphos, and points the spacecraft at it using a very sophisticated autonomous navigation system we can talk about in a few minutes. And so it's continuously taking images, once per second, for navigation but also for the purposes of understanding the target asteroid that we're going to impact, because in order to figure out what we did, what effect we had on the asteroid, we have to understand the asteroid. We know a lot about Didymos. We don't know a lot about the little moonlet Dimorphos. It's never been resolved in a telescope or even in a radar image. So, we have a vague awareness that it's longer in one dimension than the other direction. We know about how big it is. But that's all we know. We don't know what the shape is, and we don't know what the volume is. We won't know, other than by the images from the DRACO instrument on DART, what the size and shape of that asteroid is. And we also need to know where do we hit and what's the topography of the surface at the place that we hit, to understand the dynamics of the impact.  Host: Oh OK. So that data is critical for you to understand because it sounds like DART is not over after it crashes into the moonlet because you guys are going to be analyzing, you're analyzing the pictures that it takes to understand more about the moonlet, and you have some analysis to do afterwards to see what happens to the orbit of the moonlet, what happens to the, to the, I guess the, I don't know if it would be not necessarily orbit but the trajectory, I guess. I don't know what you want to call it, of Didymos and the binary system. You got a lot going forward, even after the kinetic impact.  Thomas Statler: Absolutely. Well, like I said before, DART is two tests in one. There's the test of the technology to do the kinetic impact, and there's the test of what happens to the asteroid. And that first test ends and the second test begins at the moment when the spacecraft itself is destroyed by the impact.   Host: Aha, OK.  Thomas Statler: It's a fascinating thing. And so, even after impact, you know, there will be this, I'm sure a great cheer will go up when we get the last image down and we confirm loss of signal. But at that moment, in a lot of ways, the mission's only half done because we still have a big effort of, astronomical effort, literally, using telescopes on the ground to measure the effect of what we actually did. And that's where, you know, the real results are going to come out from that. So those observations will be focused on the, the little orbit, right, the little orbit of the moonlet Dimorphos around the big asteroid Didymos. You're right that in a very tiny way, we're also changing the orbit of the pair around the Sun. But we're not planning to try to measure that because that effect is so small and so hard, so hard to measure, it may not quite be doable. After all, DART is a small spacecraft, and even though this is a full-up test, it's not a big test.  Host: Yeah. You mentioned a golf cart crashing into a stadium. So that picture you drew was, was absolutely perfect. Bring us through the first half of the mission then. Let's explore that one a little bit. In terms of the mission profile for those of us that want to watch the launch and see this thing through the kinetic impact, what is the timeline here?  Thomas Statler: OK. Well, the launch period opens nighttime on November 23rd, Pacific time, just in a few months. And if we're able to launch right at the beginning of the window, we'll launch just before midnight California time on November 23rd; it'll be the wee hours of the morning November 24th for most of the rest of the U.S. We launch onto, and we're launching from Vandenberg Space Force Base on a SpaceX Falcon 9; that'll put us on a trajectory that has a big north-south component to it because we have to do a little bit of an inclination change. We have to get away from the Earth and give ourselves an orbit around the Sun that's a little bit inclined. And that puts the spacecraft onto an orbit that will go around the Sun just about once and meet up with Didymos when it has come into near-Earth space, right at the end of September next year.  Host: OK. So about less than a year from the time of launch to actually make the kinetic impact. So that'll be a pretty big moment for you guys. Where are you going to be throughout that whole process?  Thomas Statler: At launch time?  Host: Both launch time and the kinetic impact.  Thomas Statler: Well, at launch time, I hope to be out in California, somewhere close to Vandenberg. I've never been to a launch at Vandenberg. What people tell me is that the coastal fog has a tendency to come in and prevent you from seeing much of anything. But I'm hoping we get to see a launch. And if not, we'll get to hear a launch because it does make a lot of noise. And, and of course, the launch is tremendously exciting, but it's just the beginning, right? We've got a fairly short cruise for a planetary mission. It's only a year, once around the Sun, to kinetic impact day. And at kinetic impact day, I think everybody is going to be at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab because it's APL that is operating this mission for NASA. They were building the spacecraft. We're almost ready to go. And it'll be tremendously exciting to be at the mission operations center at APL on kinetic impact day. It's going to be quite exciting watching the images come in, in almost real-time, and watching that asteroid get bigger and bigger and bigger.  Host: [Laughter] I can only imagine. So, it sounds like you're working with Johns Hopkins, that's one of the folks you're working with. What is the team that comprises the entirety of the mission that is DART?  Thomas Statler: Well, every mission has a very broad team. The major components are being built by APL. Mission operations are being done by APL. But we've also got some additional important components on the spacecraft. One of them is an ion propulsion, solar electric ion propulsion thruster, called NEXT-C. It's NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster-Commercial that we're taking for its first flight on DART. It's going to be checked out, given its first flight experience during cruise. That's a particularly innovative piece of technology that was built by NASA Glenn Research Center and Aerojet Rocketdyne. Because it’s solar electric propulsion, we need some hefty solar panels. So, we're flying these roll-out solar arrays or ROSAs that are innovative technology. They are lighter than standard solar arrays. These were built by Deployable Space Systems. There have been a couple of them deployed on the International Space Station that have worked well; we're anticipating them working really well on, on DART also. One of the other interesting things about DART is, like I said, its main imager looks out the front window. And when we successfully achieve kinetic impact, we have no more spacecraft and no more imager anymore. But the Italian Space Agency, ASI, is providing a CubeSat that will ride along on DART. It'll be deployed about ten days before the kinetic impact. It's going to use its own propulsion system to offset so that it doesn't run into anything. And it's going to follow DART in, a little bit off to the side, about three minutes behind. So, this CubeSat called the LICIACube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids) has two imagers on it; they're called Luke and Leia. Can't imagine what those are based on.  Host: [Laughter] We can only guess.  Thomas Statler: We can only guess. But they're going to try to get images of the impact itself. There should be, I imagine there will be some kind of a bright flash because there will be a lot of energy liberated at that moment. But we want to be able to see the ejecta plume, the material from the asteroid that's blown off in that energetic impact, not just for the sake of seeing it but also that ejecta gives the asteroid an additional push. It's like a little extra rocket that you attach to the asteroid at the moment of impact. The stuff blows out one way and the asteroid is pushed another way. And that's actually one of the key measurements that we're trying to make with DART, is what is this momentum enhancement that we get, not just because we hit the asteroid but because we also blew out this ejecta. So LICIA is going to give us images that'll let us see, get a handle on how much material is blown out as the ejecta and what direction it went. And then, of course, LICIA will do something that DART will not be able to do, which is go around the backside. It'll fly past, look backward, and give us a view of the backside of the asteroid that we impacted so we get a clear picture of what its size and shape is, what its volume is, and what its mass is.  Host: That is fantastic. This plume that you're talking about, is that mostly for research into the physics or is there some that's going to look at, because I know you said some of the imagery on the forward camera of DART is going to look at the composition of the asteroid, will some of that plume data help with understanding what Dimorphos is made of?  Thomas Statler: It could in some ways. With the, with the DRACO imager around DART we don't really have the ability to do much about composition. It's not a spectrograph, it's not a multicolor camera, it's just a monochrome camera. We'll be able to see, you know, geological forms. We'll be able to see craters, boulders, and get some basic information about the physical, I mean, you know, mechanical, physical properties of the asteroid, not so much about composition unless we see some, you know, we might get lucky and see some big differences in reflectivity or something like that. But more information we'll be getting is about the texture of the asteroid. Sorry, I forgot what the question was.  Host: No, no. I think I was asking about the plume itself.  Thomas Statler: Oh, the plume.  Host: Yeah, yeah. And what -- how exactly, I guess, does it help you to understand, it sounds like it's not so much the materials but the physics of it. And I think you did a pretty good job of describing.  Thomas Statler: Well, there's two aspects of it. One is how does the ejecta, what direction and how much is going in, and how much ejecta there is in terms of how does that, how does it play into the dynamics of this kinetic impact deflection? So, the information that we want to get out for planetary defense purposes is, how much of a push on an asteroid are we actually going to get if we hit it with a spacecraft? The other side of it, which is asteroid science, we might be able to get a handle on by looking at that ejecta plume from different angles, under different lighting conditions. We might be able to get a handle on the particle size distributions. So, how much really fine dust, how much, you know, gravel, how many golf ball size chunks, that sort of thing. And that gives us some more insight into the surface properties of the object.  Host: Got it. Now, we went through a couple of the centers involved and APL, of course. I want to make sure we didn't miss anyone and their involvement and contribution to DART.  Thomas Statler: Oh, boy. Well, I wouldn't even begin to try and make sure I get the whole list. I would accidentally leave somebody out and then they'd get mad at me. But, of course, I mentioned ASI, the Italian Space Agency. Argotec in Italy is the contractor that's building LICIACube. Of course, we have the involvement of NASA Glenn [Research Center], I already mentioned, Marshall; JPL, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is doing navigation. NASA Langley [Research Center] was doing some independent verification and validation. See, I know I'm already missing some people. We also have on the investigation team a lot of scientists from universities involved. I know the University of Maryland, College Park is involved, Auburn University is involved. I apologize to all of the co-investigators whose institutions I'm going to forget to list here.  Host: And I'm not going to put you through that, Tom. No way. So, we'll move on to, you sort of alluded to this a little bit earlier, but there's some pretty critical, I believe it's navigation equipment, guidance, navigation, and control. What's on board DART? What is this piece of equipment?  Thomas Statler: Well, this is really the key. We would not be able to do this mission at all if we didn't have the autonomous systems that the people at APL have designed. And so, they have a system called SMART Nav (Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real Time Navigation). And this is what enables us to execute the dynamic impact, the kinetic impact, on the asteroid. What SMART Nav does is it uses the images from the DART camera, in effect exactly the way you would expect to, right? I mean, if you were driving a car, OK -- don't do this at home -- but if you were driving a car with the intent of running into something, imagine how you would do it.  You would look out the front window and you would watch the thing you were trying to run into, and you would make sure that it just gets bigger and bigger in your windshield and doesn't go off to the side. If you see the thing you're aiming for going off to the side, that's an indication that you're not going in the right direction and you have to correct your path. So, like I said, don't do that with your car or anybody else's car but if you're building a kinetic impactor spacecraft that's exactly what you want it to do. And that's the job that's SMART Nav has, is to look out the front window, which is the DRACO imager, to see the asteroid, to identify the right one that is being targeted, and to make sure that the DART spacecraft is heading directly toward it at all times and then to send to the guidance, navigation, and control system on board the correct commands to fire the attitude control thrusters and the offset thrusters to alter the trajectory to make sure we stay on path.  Host: Very interesting. So, sticking with the car analogy, it sounds like it is literally the opposite of autonomous driving. Autonomous driving watches the obstacles and avoids them. It sounds like the key piece of technology here that's critical to the mission is to watch these -- I don't want to call it an obstacle because it's more of a target -- but to make sure you're going directly for it.  Thomas Statler: That's exactly right.  Host: [Laughter] Interesting. You mentioned the NEXT-C Thruster, xenon thrusters. Now, this is not necessarily, from the way you described it it doesn't sound like it's a critical propulsion technology, but it is more of a demonstration.  Thomas Statler: It is a demonstration. We've got two propulsion systems on the spacecraft. One is the traditional hydrazine thrusters, which have been flown many, many times before. And that's the primary propulsion system on the spacecraft. But we also have NEXT-C. We're going to check it out in flight during cruise; if it works well, we'll use it for some of our trajectory correction maneuvers as we go.  Host: But it's not critical. You'll have the hydrazine thrusters to back up on.  Thomas Statler: Absolutely. It's not critical. We're looking forward to being able to use it, but if NEXT-C has a bad day and we're not able to use it, we're absolutely certain we can still conduct the mission on hydrazine.  Host: I see. OK. Now, you mentioned the ROSAs. And, of course, we actually just released an episode on ROSAs on the International Space Station. I understand these are a bit smaller, but you've already drawn the comparison of the size of the DART vehicle. You don't need gigantic solar arrays, it sounds like, to power the instruments that are on board DART.  Thomas Statler: That's right. If all we were doing, if we weren't, I don't want to say it this way because NEXT-C has been such an integral component of the mission from the beginning. I don't want to make it seem like I'm tossing them overboard.   Host: Sure, sure.  Thomas Statler: But had the mission been designed a different way and it were only the camera, we would not need such large solar arrays. The large solar arrays are there because we are using the mission to give NEXT-C a very thorough shakedown cruise.  Host: I understand. OK. Very cool. Now, what other technologies, you know, you mentioned it's the size of a, I think you said vending machine, the size of a vending machine. You got your cameras. You got your guidance, navigation, and control. You got your thrusters. Are we missing any other key pieces of technology that make up the shape of this spacecraft?  Thomas Statler: There are a variety of other things. The high-gain antenna for communication with the Earth is a particularly interesting one. If you look at it, you would say is that an antenna or is it a pizza pan or something? It doesn't look like a traditional parabolic antenna. It's a flat plate with a bunch of little slots cut in it. And it's called a radial slot line array antenna, which uses a really interesting combination of little phased, well, for antenna geeks out there, little phased dipoles all around this circular plate, to, to play the same role that a parabolic antenna would have and give us really good gain in transmission as well as reception. So that's one of the most conspicuous things. The other interesting bits of technology are on the inside in the computer hardware, the use of the field-programmable gate arrays that are running the SMART Nav software, and things like.  Host: Awesome. Now, we are recording this in August. I think the episode itself will release in September. Closing in on that November window, that opens up to actually meet your target and collide or crash into Dimorphos in September of next year. What is there left to do on your timeline to make sure you are ready for when that window opens?  Thomas Statler: Well, the spacecraft is on track to be shipped to the launch site. And so, that'll be certainly the biggest thing that's coming, but all of the main systems are installed. Everything is on. NEXT-C is on. DRACO is on. The solar arrays are on the spacecraft. It's really just the final checkouts that are being done at APL. And then we ship to the site and get into our integration with the launch vehicle. There are still some system tests and simulations that are being done. We're going to be fine-tuning some of the, some of the navigation parameters, to make sure that we maximize our chances of executing the kinetic impact correctly when we want to, and planning for the things that you do in cruise on a planetary mission. That is, you check out the instruments, you calibrate the cameras; all of those things are being planned.  Host: Very cool. Now, you're in the home stretch here and, of course, all getting to that critical moment of the kinetic impact. It sounds like you got a lot that's packed into this mission. Besides the key, I guess, goal of the mission is to make a successful kinetic impact and then measure the effect of that on the physics of the orbit of Dimorphos and around Didymos and how the binary system itself is affected, what other key areas are you planning to explore, maybe physics-wise, that maybe go beyond that, did this work or was this a successful impact?  Thomas Statler: Oh yeah, there are lots of questions. And, and, you know, the, the texture of the landscape, the scientific landscape, has actually changed a little bit in the last couple of years because, if you had asked me this two, three years ago, I probably would have said, we're not really expecting any surprises. We think the kinetic impact is going to be exactly what you think it's going to be. The response is going to fit in, going to be in accord with our computer simulations and so on. And yet we've had a couple of surprises in asteroid science in the last couple of years. The Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa2, which is now, has brought its samples back from the asteroid Ryugu, they did an experiment at the asteroid Ryugu which they had a separate thing, an explosive device, that sent a small impactor at high speed down into the surface of the asteroid. And it was a surprise because, in some ways, it did what was expected, it dug a little crater, it went bang and dug a little crater, and ejecta came out. But the surprise was the process of, well, let me back up. If you think about it, if you just imagine, what should that look like? You're firing a projectile into the surface of an asteroid at a few thousand miles an hour. And you think about that, and it should probably go bang and stuff flies around, and then the dust settles, and it's done. And that's not quite what happened. That process of excavating the crater and stuff coming out of the crater went on for minutes, which was more than a bit of a surprise. And what it told us was that there was basically no strength to that material. There was no cohesion to it. There was no stickiness to it. Everything was just controlled by gravity. And so, there was nothing to slow this process down. Even though it was going in slow motion, real-time slow motion, it just took forever for it to develop. And a lot more material was excavated from the crater than people were expecting. So that was surprise number one. Surprise number two was the OSIRIS-REx (Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security-Regolith Explorer) spacecraft at the asteroid Bennu, that is now on the way home with its sample. When it did its sampling attempt and touched down very gently on the surface with its TAG sampler to just do a touch and go, that's what TAG stands for, it touched the surface and the surface didn't push back. It just sort of went into the surface. It sort of paints a picture of this asteroid that if you walked up to the side of the asteroid and you poked it, your arm would just go right into it. It was amazingly delicate material. And so, because we've got evidence that these asteroids can be, you know, very, very delicate material and slow to respond, I'm anticipating some surprises when we actually execute the kinetic impact on Dimorphos.  Host: Wow. So in terms of what excites you about the mission, in addition to what you said about how excited you were for launch and to be at APL for the kinetic impact, it sounds like one of the things is what is going to surprise me that's exciting you most about this mission.  Thomas Statler: Well, I mean, boy, where do I begin? [Laughter] Yeah. There's a lot of asteroids in the solar system, but it's becoming clear that there's no such thing as just another asteroid. And every asteroid has something surprising and new to tell us. Every time we get a spacecraft to a different asteroid, our socks get knocked off, and then we have to put our socks back on. And then the next one knocks our socks off again. So, I'm not going to make any bets about what is going to happen at Dimorphos. I know we're going to execute the kinetic impact. I know there's going to be a measurable effect. I know I'm going to be really, really thrilled to see the telescopic observations following the kinetic impact that show me the period of the asteroid has changed. And, and let's just focus on that for a second because that's going to be an event of historical proportions, right? When we get those observations back that show that the period of this binary asteroid has been changed, that will be the first time that humanity has actually changed something in space. I mean, we've left footprints and tire tracks and things like that on various bodies, but this will be the first-time humanity has changed a celestial motion.  Host: Interestingly. We've observed, we've collected samples, but this, yeah, you're right, this is the first time we're changing something. Wow. Unbelievable. And that's -- due to the team that's putting this mission together, the work that you're doing, and it sounds like the work that's being brought together from several different centers, several different teams. What's it like working on the DART team?  Thomas Statler: Oh, the DART team is fantastic. It's, it’s tremendously professional, dedicated people. In addition to that, there are people on the investigation team that I've known for years through research and, you know, I've been friends with them. So, working with them in this capacity has just been great. I can't say enough about the team at APL, the team at the collaborating universities, the LICIACube team from ASI has been great. This team has really pulled together and gotten through the pandemic, and we're still launching the spacecraft this year.  Host: That's right. Doesn't matter on the obstacles, you guys are still getting the mission done. So that's amazing to hear. And honestly, I'm rooting for you. Tom, this was a fascinating discussion to have with you today. And honestly, you got me excited about the mission. I'm very much looking forward to launch, and I'm very much looking forward to just the excitement of all there is to learn, and now especially the surprises that may come along the way. I love the way you described that every asteroid is unique, and so, it's not just another asteroid. So, what surprises does this one have to offer? I can't wait to find out. Tom, thanks for coming on.  Thomas Statler: Thanks so much, Gary. Glad you're excited.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around! I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Dr. Thomas Statler today. He got me really excited for this upcoming DART mission.

The initial orbit is designed to be at a high altitude – about 435 miles (700 kilometers) above the asteroid's surface.  Over the following 20 months, the spacecraft will use its electric propulsion system to dip into lower and lower orbits as it conducts its science investigation. Eventually, the spacecraft will establish a final orbit (Orbit D) about 53 miles (85 kilometers) above the surface.  Set to launch in August 2022, Psyche will investigate a metal-rich asteroid of the same name, which lies in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists believe the asteroid could be part or all of the iron-rich interior of an early planetary building block that was stripped of its outer rocky shell as it repeatedly collided with other large bodies during the early formation of the solar system.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24896"

Psyche is the focal point of NASA's mission of the same name. The Psyche spacecraft is set to launch in August 2022 and arrive at the asteroid in 2026, where it will orbit for 21 months and investigate its composition.  Based on data obtained from Earth, scientists believe Psyche is a mixture of metal and rock. The rock and metal may be in large provinces, or areas, on the asteroid — as illustrated in this rendering. Another possibility is that rock and metal may be intimately mixed on a scale too small to detect from orbit — as depicted in an illustration here: PIA24472. Observing and measuring how the metal and rock are mixed will help scientists determine how Psyche formed.  Exploring the asteroid could also give valuable insight into how our own planet and others formed. The Psyche team will use a magnetometer to measure the asteroid's magnetic field. A multispectral imager will capture images of the surface, as well as data about the Psyche's composition and topography. Spectrometers will analyze the neutrons and gamma rays coming from the surface to reveal the elements that make up the asteroid itself.

                      "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 235, “Scouting an Asteroid.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight – and more. In our last episode we talked about NASA's mega-rocket, the Space Launch System or SLS slated to launch soon on the first Artemis mission, Artemis I. The primary objective of the first Artemis mission, Artemis I, is testing the Orion spacecraft and the SLS on a mission around the Moon and returning safely to Earth for the first time. But this highly-anticipated launch is also jam-packed with secondary objectives and payloads -- payloads being the stuff we're bringing on the rocket. A few episodes back, we talked about BioSentinel, a microbiology experiment in deep space; there are many other secondary payloads like this aboard Artemis I. So we're going to highlight another one. This one has its sights set on an asteroid.  The experiment is called Near-Earth Asteroid Scout, or NEA Scout. Like BioSentinel, it's another one of those shoebox-sized spacecrafts called a CubeSat that will be deployed from the SLS, but this one will unfold a massive 925 square foot solar sail as a means to navigate to a near-Earth asteroid and gather data that can't be collected by observations from the Earth. How the solar sail works and what kinds of science we're going to do, that's what we find out on this episode. We're bringing in the experts on the solar sail and on the asteroid science. For the NEA Scout sail, we have Principal Investigator Les Johnson, and for the NEA Scout science, Principal Investigator Julie Castillo-Rogez. Come sail away with me, to an asteroid with Les Johnson and Julie Castillo-Rogez. Enjoy!  [Music]  Host: Les and Julie, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. What an exciting experiment, lots of cool stuff happening on Artemis I. This one just caught my eye because, you know, visually, if I'm thinking about as things are released, or deployed from the SLS, this is one that I think visually jumps out, because it's got a giant sail and of course it's going to a very cool place. I want to talk about this experiment, go deep into what this is all about and how it works. Lucky to have both of you on this, because we're going to tackle that cool sail, and we're also going to tackle the purpose of the experiment itself, the science, where we're going and what we're doing. Les, I want to start with you, you’re the lead principal investigator for, for the sails, which is a very cool technology; quick background and just what, what career path you took to get you to this position as the principal investigator for such a cool experiment?    Les Johnson: Well, quick background is I am a physicist by education, I've been at NASA for about 30 years, and I have always been a futurist and in my career I've focused on advanced propulsion, new ways to move spacecraft around in space. I became interested in solar sails, which is a way to fly once you get out of a planetary environment and you're in deep space, away from the air and all the disturbances we have on the ground; it's a very efficient way to get from place to place, and to go to distant destinations we need more efficient spacecraft propulsion. So this was, one that was a particular interest to me. And, and how I got here is a long story: it's 20 years of ground-based technology development, writing mission proposals, and working with some really smart people to move the technology forward.    Host: Very interesting. I am very excited to get into this particular technology. It's good to know what, what got you there. And then of course, we're going to explore what that is. Julie, over to you: quick background, I know you, you, have an interest in planetary science and you've done a number of different things in that world. What led you to this particular experiment, NEA Scout?    Julie Castillo-Rogez: Yeah. So as you can get from my accent, I did all my studies in France and the laboratory I was involved in had a stake in the Cassini-Huygens mission. So that was in the mid-90s. And so I was very lucky one day to meet a principal investigator on the Cassini mission, and she invited me to come to JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and to do post-doctoral research at JPL. And so I came about twenty years ago, next month, and it’s been a fantastic experience working at JPL. So I've been on the Cassini mission and several other missions and especially one that played a big role in my career is the Dawn mission, that explored the dwarf planet Ceres in the asteroid belt, and I was the project scientist for that mission, during its extended, its extended period. So Ceres is the biggest object in the asteroid belt; NEA Scout is going to target the smallest asteroid ever visited by spacecraft, and so that is very exciting to me, to, to have been able to explore both the largest and the smallest asteroid in the solar system. And, and so I got involved in NEA Scout in 2013, I was part of a group at JPL pioneering deep space CubeSats. And we had already been working on a mission called INSPIRE (Interplanetary NanoSpacecraft Pathfinder In Relevant Environment), which did not fly but basically was the first step into the introduction of a new class of radios that allow us to communicate with CubeSats. And so we proposed to an opportunity from the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate and, and we got selected and, and then it was great because Les proposed a similar idea and, you know, I think the sponsor offered, oh, wow, you have these two groups of people, they really want to do the same thing so it must be very important. And that's how we got started.    Host: Very interesting, Julie; largest asteroid, smallest asteroid, that is, that is awesome. A very interesting, very interesting world to explore, this world of asteroids, and that is what this is doing. I hope I'm saying it right. Les, is it, is it N-E-A Scout? I was saying NEA Scout, but I think it's N-E-A Scout?   Les Johnson: Well, I think it's, it's a matter of choice, Near-Earth Asteroid Scout, NEA Scout, yeah, all of those will work.  Host: So what is it then? What is, what, taking what this CubeSat is and what it's going do, what, what is this mission that we're doing?    Les Johnson: Well, let, just, just to maybe start that out, first off let's get a matter of size. I, I think it's really important for people to understand the size of things that we're dealing with here. This spacecraft is really small. It's going on the biggest rocket NASA has launched in decades, but the whole spacecraft is only what's called a 6U CubeSat. And to put that in perspective, it's about the size of a boot box. OK, so it's a pretty small spacecraft, and it's, it's a fully functional interplanetary spacecraft. There are a lot of these CubeSats that fly in Earth orbit and they do great things, but they're close to home, they don't have to have a lot of power, they don't have to have particularly radiation- hard electronics to survive the deep space environment, and they certainly don't deploy big solar sails that are almost a thousand square feet in area, which is what our sail will look like. So it was quite a, quite a challenge that the JPL team, who built the spacecraft, worked toward, and for us here at NASA Marshall [Space Flight Center] to put the, the solar sail in. So NEA Scout will be a secondary payload on the Space Launch System, after the Orion, which is the human crew capsule, the primary mission for the launch of Artemis I is on its way to the Moon. We're one of the 13 small spacecraft that'll then be deployed from the SLS rocket’s upper stage. And our little, tiny spacecraft will be ejected from a little box in there. The spacecraft will stabilize itself; it'll deploy its solar panels. I'll test the radio, call home and say, hello, I'm here, let's make sure everything's working. It'll be on a path toward the Moon. And the spacecraft will have a, a small thruster, conventional little chemical thruster called a cold gas thruster, that'll put it on a trajectory so that it doesn't hit the Moon and goes around it. And after we've been in the lunar vicinity for a while is when we’ll deploy the solar sail, which will give us the primary propulsion to take the spacecraft and the camera that Julie has on board the spacecraft to the asteroid, which will take about two years, give or take, depends on when we actually launch, in order to do the science at that asteroid. And we will be controlling the solar sail, the way that it points, which determines our thrust and how we travel the whole time during that mission. And then when we get near the asteroid, Julie will take over and, as we approach, she'll be using the onboard instrument to do the science at the asteroid.    Host: Awesome; perfect mission profile. Obviously, I, I, and Les, I want to get into the objectives of the solar sail itself, but before, before we do that let's go over to Julie for a second. Julie, Les mentioned science, do the science. High level, what is the science that we're doing?    Julie Castillo-Rogez: So, we are going to obtain observations that help prepare for a future crewed mission. So the science is really about understanding the physical properties of near-Earth asteroid. And these physical properties include getting the size and the morphology on regional and global scale. The rotation properties, so the spin period, the position of the pole, that is very important when planning for a future crewed mission to understand how this kind of object is behaving from a dynamical standpoint, in order to prepare for operation, especially because with smaller asteroids they can have a very fast spin rate, and so that could be dangerous for operating at the surface of these objects. And then, at closest approach, we are going to obtain high resolution imaging of the order of ten centimeter per pixel, and that will tell us about the structure of the surface, what we, we call the regolith, it will tell us if the surface is very rocky, or it is very porous. Again, this is critical information in order to prepare for a future crewed mission.    Host: All right. So that's the science that we're doing, Julie. And I think what, what I'd like to get into now is just the how, and get into the details both from, from the sail’s perspective, and then Julie we’ll go to you as well from the science perspective and talk about how we're characterizing and what instruments we're using and what, and what, what that data science collection period is going to look like. top, top to bottom. Les, we'll start with you, the sails, right? You mentioned that the sails are going to be deployed around the Moon. Let's get into what this is. You, you, you already gave us a little bit of a preview; you're talking about a CubeSat that's the size of a boot box, that's going to deploy an, a nearly 1000 square foot sail. That is huge. Let's talk about what that is. What are the materials used, how that's going to work; what is that technology, Les, that is behind these sails?    Les Johnson: Well, here is solar sail technology 101, right? Your listeners are familiar with sunlight or any light, and when it reflects from you and someone sees you, the, the particles of light, the photons, are reflecting from you and going to someone's eye. What, what you don't feel when light reflects from you -- it's a beautiful sunny day here in Alabama; if I were to go outside and, and bask in the Sun, a lot of light’s reflecting from me, but it's also pushing on me. Light, although it doesn't have any rest mass, it does have a little bit of momentum. And so, if you think of a particle of light, a photon, as being like a little BB and it bounces off of you, as it bounces off of you it's, it's giving a little bit of its momentum to you and pushing on you. Now that push is very, very small. If you were to take all of the sunlight at noon falling on two football stadiums, it would be roughly the same force as you would feel in the palm of your hand if you put a quarter and a nickel in your hand; you'd feel it was there, but it isn't much. And that little bit of force when you're away from the gravity and the air and all these things, it will inevitably start pushing on whatever it's reflecting from. And so if you have a, a large, very lightweight reflector, reflector -- think of a sail on a sailing ship, but much lighter weight -- reflecting visible light, so it's coated with aluminum -- and the material we use for our sail is a plastic, it's, it’s got a, you know, exciting name: Clear Polyimide 1, but it's coated with aluminum to make it reflective, to maximize the number of photons reflecting from it -- that little push is constant because the Sun's always shining. And when you deploy it in space, your spacecraft will start to respond to that, and it will move. And it'll move faster and faster and faster and keep accelerating as long as there is sunlight falling on it. And that's important because when you're traveling to these deep space destinations you, you have to get a lot of velocity and you have a long trip time because you have to go millions of miles to get there. And you might as well do it as efficiently as you can for, for mass. And so if you take the middle third of our boot box, we, we figured out you could put a sail of 925 square feet, almost a thousand square feet, folded and rolled on a spool that would be deployed out with four metallic booms that a, a motor starts to, to push out of the spacecraft. And as the booms come out, the sail is attached to each one of the four booms, and it slowly comes off the spool until you have this flat sheet of sail lying on these booms, attached to the spacecraft that's out in space. Once the sail is deployed, we orient it to the direction we want the sunlight to fall from it, and the spacecraft will slowly start to accelerate beyond whatever speed the rocket gave it. And we tip and tilt the sail to change the angle with which the light reflects from the sail, because that changes the direction of the momentum that the light gives the spacecraft to push it, so it allows us to steer. So it, it is completely analogous to, to how, the, before we had steam engines and all that, that the big schooners and the sailing ships would cross the oceans, they were subject to the wind and the particles of air reflecting from the sail. But instead of that, and it's not solar wind, that's a different thing; we're reflecting sunlight to make our sail move. And it, if you, if you look at a comparison with our spacecraft, if you had taken a conventional rocket propulsion engine in the same volume, put as much prop, propellant, in there and fuel as you could and said, go, you wouldn't get nearly the performance over a two-year mission that we get with a sail to get us where we're going. We really have to have a sail to do this mission. So that's kind of solar sailing 101.    Host: So what I, a couple things I pulled from that, that I found particularly interesting. One was it sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like you have a little bit of direction but it sounds like the acceleration is small, but constant; is that a good readback? Is, is that what's happening?  Les Johnson: Absolutely. And that's why it's, that's why it's so efficient. I, I like to do the tortoise and hare comparison. We're all familiar with that child's story, right? And if you were to take the so, the, a solar sail that we have on NEA Scout, and you deploy it and next to it, you have a small spacecraft that's the same size but instead of the volume in the spacecraft where we have the sail you have that conventional propulsion system, and you're having a race and you say go, the, the little rocket engine will fire and the small CubeSat will take off and it'll be out of sight in a few seconds or minutes. And you'll wonder if the solar sail is ever going to move; it'll just sit there. But over days it will have started moving and it'll start moving faster and faster, and because you can only put so much propellant in this other spacecraft, it won't be too long before, since it has, it runs out of gas and so it can't accelerate anymore, it, it keeps going at whatever speed it was going when it ran out of fuel; our solar sail will pass it and keep accelerating because of that constant, low thrust. So it, it is a much more efficient in the small spacecraft case -- you have to have something pretty lightweight for this to work -- much more efficient than just about any chemical system you could put in the same volume.    Host: So what's, what are some of the pros and what are some of the cons with having a low acceleration, but it sounds like there's no, there's no way to stop accelerating if, if, if maybe that's a good readback as well. Is that, is that, is there any issues to that or is that maybe a good thing?    Les Johnson: Well, it, it, the, or the, the way orbits work, help you and hurt you in this case. Yes, you're correct, globally, in that you can't turn off the Sun, so as long as you're close to the Sun the sail will continue to give you some kind of, of acceleration. And that's one of the reasons this is an asteroid flyby and not an asteroid rendezvous, and that we aren't going to be able just to match velocity and, and stay right next to the asteroid. We're going to slowly fly by the asteroid for Julie's camera to do its work.  And, but that's not quite the same as not being able to slow down, because you can tilt the sail to give you acceleration in the direction you're already moving, which makes you go faster, or you can tilt it opposite that to give you some acceleration in the opposite direction, which is decelerating, and you actually slow down. So you, you can use the sail to accelerate or decelerate during flight. You just can't stop accelerating or decelerating, [laughter] If that makes sense.    Host: It makes a lot of sense. I didn't think about turning it the other way, but, but absolutely it, it would just be slow, right, so, so there's, I guess there's limits to, to how you, how you work that, but the, but the possibility exists. And, and, and the idea that you're doing a flyby not a rendezvous into an orbit makes a lot of sense for, for what this technology is used for and what its purpose is. The other question I was going to ask…oh, sorry, Les, go ahead.    Les Johnson: Yeah. You asked what the limitations were. I didn't mean to interrupt you. The, the limitations of a sail are that it's really primarily used for a small lightweight spacecraft. And the reason for that is that low acceleration. In Newton's laws, force equals mass times acceleration, and the sunlight force is constant so in order to have a large acceleration that's usable, you have to have a very low mass spacecraft. So a solar sail works really well for a spacecraft that might weigh, you know, 10 to, to 20 pounds, maybe up to a hundred pounds with a much larger sail. But if you're talking about something for human-class mission, the sail would have to have, you know, immense area and be much lighter weight than we can ever build today -- well, I won't say ever; anything that we could build today to be useful. So one of the limitations are, this is really only useful with small spacecraft today, and those near the Sun. It's not a one size fits all propulsion system.    Host: Understood, understood. Real, real quick on the, on the, materials, you mentioned, you mentioned it was like a, a sort of a thin plastic, it was a very interesting material, but, just to, to pull back and think high level about what, what the, what the idea is here, it sounds like one of the important things is maybe low on the mass side, you want, you want a lightweight material, but you also want something that, and, and I don't know if I'm reading this back right, either, but what exactly about, what properties of that material allow the sunlight to do its job and provide that acceleration -- something lightweight, and then, and then what other properties?    Les Johnson: Reflective, reflective of sunlight.    Host: Reflective. Got it.  Les Johnson: Reflective. And in fact, the, the substrate material, which gives the sail its strength is the plastic, but it's clear. And therefore the light would pass through and not, not do much in the way of propulsion. So we have to, to essentially spray-coat a thin layer of aluminum on it, which reflects 90%, 92% of the visible light, to give it its reflective properties. So you want a reflective coating and you want the substrate, what that coating is on, to be lightweight and strong because you don't want to tear or rip the sail while you're handling it to fabricate it or packaging it or deploying it. So it has to have a mixture of being really lightweight, which means it might be flimsy and easily damaged, and reflective, but not much mass, and trying to optimize that was the challenge.    Host: Got it. Now the interesting art of folding this thing. This is, this is a big question I have, Les, is how do you get such a large sail to fit in such a small area? And then how is that deployed?  Les Johnson: Well, the, the sail material itself. first off, think, it's really thin. It, it's basically thinner than a human hair.   Host: Oh, wow.  Les Johnson: So the way I like to describe it is if you go to your kitchen and you get out Saran Wrap, imagine Saran Wrap that's thinner than the Saran Wrap in your kitchen and not sticky. And that's kind of what I, I think it, it feels like. Aluminum foil would be way too heavy, and aluminum foil more easily rips, so I don't give that as the example.  It's a little harder to tear, you know, the plastic wrap that's in your kitchen. So just imagine a lightweight plastic wrap with aluminum on it. That's the material. And for, for this mission, we deploy a single large sail, and there are different approaches to, to building solar sail, but we settled on that for NEA Scout. And the best way to think about it is if you lay a piece of paper on, on, and you, you're folding it, you, you, you fold it back and forth into a long, thin strip. So you do what's called a z-fold. You, you take it, you, you fold the paper along its edge to whatever thickness you want, and then you just back and forth fold it until it kind of makes an accordion shape. And then you roll it, like roll it around your finger; we're rolling it onto a spool. And that's how it's packaged for deployment in, in the spacecraft. And then below that is where we have these four metallic booms, which are like tape measures but instead of a curved and kind of a U-shape when they're deployed, like if you take your tape measure, a metallic tape measure, and deploy it, it stays for, for a distance it'll stay vertical or extended because it's kind of a U-shape to it that keeps it extended and not just falling to the ground in gravity; ours, instead of a U it's got kind of a V-shape to it after it's off the spool. So just imagine a, tape measures, four tape measure spools, where we have a motor that instead of pulling the tape measure out, we push it out, and as the tip of the tape measure goes out it's attached with a little spring to the four corners of the sail and it just pulls it off the spool. So as the booms are going out the spool is slowly rotating and the sail is coming off, until the booms are at full length and the sail is a flat plane. I hope that comes across on a podcast. [Laughter]  Host: [Laughter] I know it be, it would be so much better on a, on a, on a visual side, but, but that description was very artful, Les. I think it was good. I, I'm assuming you're going to be monitoring the deployment and everything and, and that's really the base of my next question, is on the, the objectives here: you're the principal investigator for the sails on NEA Scout, what are your main objectives for, for this experiment?    Les Johnson: Well, there have been numerous smaller solar sails deployed in Earth orbit as deployment demonstrations. There was one that was in 2010 that NASA flew, it's called NanoSail-D; The Planetary Society, a privately-funded group, has flown two that were three times larger than the NanoSail-D. This will be the first sail this large that the U.S. has flown. The Japanese flew one in 2010 called IKAROS, I-K-A-R-O-S (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun), and it was a deployment demo, it didn't go anywhere to do science; very different design, too. But this will be the largest sail that we've ever flown, and it's not just a deployment demonstration, we're actually going to demonstrate that you can deploy it, you can control the direction of the thrust, and you can use it to perform a real science mission. So the objectives of the solar sail propulsion system are, first and foremost, to demonstrate that we can deploy it and control and navigate with the sail, and the second major requirement is that we get Julie's camera where it needs to be so she can do her science. So those are the, those are the simplest ways to state our objectives. It's a technology demonstration, and an enabler for science.    Host: Understood. So, so Julie, from your perspective, lot of pressure that you got to put on Les and his team to make sure that he gets you where you need to go.    Julie Castillo-Rogez: Yeah. [Laughter] So, thank you, Les. Good luck. So, the thing is that we are going to demonstrate a lot of the capability we want to accomplish at the asteroid, the capability we are also going to demonstrate it in cislunar space after deployment. We want to check that the camera is working properly and is meeting performance requirements. And hopefully we will be able to image the Moon, because we are getting close to it multiple times, and that would be such a great reward for this mission to get pictures of the Moon. And so, we are looking forward to that. But yeah, the, the bulk of the science that we want to accomplish takes place about two, two years after launch. And so we need to get to the asteroid three months before the encounter, we will start getting observations of the target in terms of, you know, getting its position; we want to be able to locate it very fast, and very well in order to use a technique called optical navigation to get close to it. And it's thanks to optical navigation that we can target a very close, low altitude flyby. So we are planning to fly by less than one kilometer in altitude. And our camera is very performant, it's the smallest camera that is used for science and used on a CubeSat. So it's very performant, and we hope to get these images with a very good quality and also with high resolution of 10 centimeter per pixel.    Host: So from the ground you can observe this experiment, or not experiment, you can observe this asteroid, right, but it can't tell you everything. So what are the gaps that this NEA Scout mission is going to, is going to fill, getting nice and close, and, and what, and exactly what kinds of images are you going to take that allow you to fill those gaps of what you can't observe from the ground?    Julie Castillo-Rogez: Yeah, that's a great question because we are capable with ground-based observatories to find a lot of asteroids, and in fact about every week there is an announcement of, I mean the discovery of a near-Earth asteroid coming very close to Earth. And so, we can detect these objects, but we can characterize them very well from the ground, unless they are relatively large, you know, a few hundred-meter across, or they are coming very close to Earth. And so, our targets, we have had multiple targets for NEA Scout in, in the course of the, of the year, our targets are very small, they are about ten meters across. And so from the ground we can only pinpoint them in the sky, but we are not able to tell anything about their properties, even the, we can’t, for example, get their rotation properties from the ground, and so for this we need to get very close to the target.   Host: In terms of this particular experiment, when it comes to near-Earth asteroids and what we know about them, is, from your perspective as a planetary scientist, has something like this been done before, have we been able to characterize small near-Earth asteroids in such a way that NEA Scout is doing right now, or is this sort of breaking new ground when it comes to understanding these smaller near-Earth asteroids?    Julie Castillo-Rogez: So there have been multiple missions to near-Earth asteroids, and of course there is ongoing OSIRIS-REx mission, from NASA, and the Japanese space agency is also running the Hayabusa2 mission.  And they got, they received very recently their samples from an asteroid called Ryugu. And so, yeah, there have been missions to near-Earth asteroids but these are generally a few hundred meters in size. In our case, we are targeting these smaller objects and not necessarily driven by science requirements, but because the largest population of objects that we can reach with NEA Scout is with this class of asteroids, all on the order of 10 to 20 meters across. So the very nice thing is that it's the first time that we will be able to observe one of these objects up close. And they're interesting for multiple reasons. One is that they are potential targets for human exploration, and that is the original intent of NEA Scout is to provide reconnaissance of these objects for a future crewed mission. But they are also interested for science. We want to understand why we have this small objects wandering around; we think they are ejecta from asteroids in the main belt of asteroids at three astronomical units. But we don't really understand their nature, and so what we will do with NEA Scout, you know, is of scientific value.  And then the third very important thing that we are going to get out of this mission is information about a class of objects that is considered a potential issue for planetary defense. And, because there are relatively numerous, and they can create some damage when these objects, when these objects cross the atmosphere, they can create some, shockwave that can be harmful to people on the ground.    Host: Understood. Yeah. Defending the globe; not a bad, not a bad scientific objective to, to tackle here.  Now, now when it comes to actually gathering this data, when it comes to, you said it's going to be about two years until you actually get to the, get, get to the asteroid; how, what are, what are you doing, what is your team doing on the ground to prepare for that moment? How, how are you getting the data and mobilizing your team and receiving the data that you want, making sure that all of the systems are working; what are you doing in terms of the operations?    Julie Castillo-Rogez: We want to get very close to the asteroid, as I noted, we, we start doing optical navigation a few weeks before closest approach. And the key here is to be able to point the camera at the target throughout the duration of the flyby. And the flyby is about three hours long, because as Les noted earlier, I mean, a great advantage of the solar sail is that we can slow it down very efficiently. And so we are going to accomplish a very, very slow flyby, and I think it's the slowest flyby of a planetary body ever accomplished by NASA. It's going to be of the order of 10 to 20 meters per second. So, even if our object is very tiny, actually we can observe it for about three hours and, which is great duration because we can get a lot of images and we will be able to accomplish our objectives. But we need to be able to point the camera at the target throughout this duration, and that takes a lot of effort from a navigation standpoint, because the sail, it needs to be maneuvered, we need to understand its behavior in order to plan a trajectory that get us the science.  Host: Now, Les, from, from your team, sounds like one of, one of Julie's, you know, hit, while her team is getting ready to, to take some of the photos, it's up to you to, to get the spacecraft where it needs to be, to slow it down to the, to the anticipated speed. So, so what are you guys doing in terms of the operations side, from, from the solar sail, and then are you talking with, with Julie's team, to, to make sure everything's going smoothly?    Les Johnson: Oh, I can't imagine not talking with Julie's team. [Laughter] Yeah, our team, and it's a pretty extensive team, we have, we have some, some really talented people working on this, doing something that no one's ever done before, which is controlling a solar sail in flight from, from essentially point A to point B. And that's a lot more challenging than it might appear, because not only do you have to be concerned that the sail deploys intact -- doesn't tear or get stuck during deployment or rip or something like that -- once it's deployed, if there's any, inhomogeneity in the sail, if there, if there's some, if, if one part of the sail doesn't look essentially like another part of the sail, then you get uneven reflection of sunlight. And that can cause a torque, which can cause your sail to start, well, just imagine if you, if you deploy something and you push harder on one side of it than you do the other because of some small hole in the sail or, or something that didn't deploy quite right, you eventually start spinning or lose control, because you're, you're not pushing on the sail equally. If it's perfectly flat and your spacecraft’s right in the middle, and you're pointed directly at the Sun and the forces are even on a whole sail and it's pretty simple, but, but life isn't like that. There, there, we're not going to be pointing straight at the Sun all the time, there's bound to be a little billowing, maybe a small tear here or there in the sail. So you're going to have differences in the sunlight pressure across the surface. And we have to detect that and balance the forces on the sail actively using something called an active mass translator, which is, is a fancy way of saying that we, we have the bulk of the spacecraft attached to the sail on a table that can go back and forth and up and down, and so, we, we maneuver the, the spacecraft mass to even out its location compared to where we might have uneven forces pushing on the sail, which could cause us to lose control. We call that our momentum management. And so when we deploy this sail, we have to learn its characteristics. We've got a new propulsion system; how, how's this going to fly? So we have to get our feet wet first and foremost, thinking in terms of, wow, we've got a little bit more force on this corner of the sail than we anticipated, we have to compensate by moving things around a little bit. And, and as we navigate, we have to be aware of this, you know, this problem and, and take that into account as we point the sail. And then as the mission goes along and we fly those characteristics, hopefully won't change a lot, but they could. For instance, if a small micro-meteorite puts a tiny hole in the sail or something else happens, and, and we get a different orientation, we have to detect that and compensate for it to continue to control the sail. So when, when I look at this, for years people developing sails, and I was guilty of this too, I used to think that the hardest part was building a big lightweight sail and getting it to deploy in space. And that is a challenge, but we've done big sails and we've deployed big ones on the ground and we think we know how to do that. Turns out, I think the biggest challenge we're going to have is that learning to fly, and managing that momentum and making sure that we can keep control of the sail with sufficient accuracy to target the asteroid and get where we need to be when we need to be there. So our operations initially are going to be pretty intense, trying to figure out how is this thing flying. And then once we get used to it, we can get into a cadence of, of not having to actively fly it as frequently. The, the nice thing about a sail is that nothing happens quickly. This is a small amount of acceleration. So if there is a problem and the sail starts to tip or tilt and give us some control problems, it's not going to happen rapidly, we'll have time to detect that with the instruments, talk to it through the deep space radio network and, and give it the commands we need to, to keep the control and, and keep flying in the direction we want to go. So that, that's kind of how the operations are going to be. It'll be very intense the first couple of months, and then we expect it'll get a little bit more relaxed and a little less intense until we get to the asteroid rendezvous phase, when it'll ramp up again.    Host: So what's interesting here is we're talking about this timeline, right, of, of post-deployment from the Space Launch System on Artemis I, you got, you said, it's going to be a very dynamic a couple of months, and then you can slow down. The rendezvous time being, you know, maybe two, two years I think is what you guys are estimating, down the line until you actually get to the target asteroid. What's interesting from your team though, Les is after you meet that objective and, and you, you get to the asteroid at the anticipated rendezvous site at the anticipated speed, Julie can do, Julie and her team can do her theme, thing, what are you guys going to do after that?  Where is this thing going to sail to? Can you continue on and just keep testing?    Les Johnson: Well, that's the beauty of a solar sail, is if the mechanical systems are all still working and the computer system hasn't been basically damaged by some solar radiation event, which is a risk over this time period, then in theory we can do something else. And so we will be looking during the mission at what those something elses are. And we've already started thinking about it. One option would be if, if Julie and her team come back and say, you know, we, we got 80% of the surface covered and we've looked at this, and if we go back by the asteroid, we can get a hundred percent, say -- I'm just making these numbers up, Julie can correct them -- there are trajectories we could do with the sail, where we fly out, turn around and come back and do another flyby. Might take a few months, but we can do that. Another option would be, if everything's still functional, we will have been tracking what other NEAs could be in range and all the flight operations constraints -- we, we can't go too far away from the Earth because we'll lose radio contact, so there are a lot of constraints that kind of confine where we can fly -- it could be we go visit another NEA and give Julie's team something else to look at. Then, then there's always the possibility that we, we, that from a technology point of view, one of the things I'd like to do is, is test the limits of our ability to control the spacecraft, and basically start changing the angle with regard to the Sun to higher and higher incidence angles to see how well we can control it so that we learn the limits of control of the system. Now the, the downside to that is, is once you exceed the limit of control, you've lost control and the mission is over. But we would learn a lot from that, and it would help us design the next missions. So there, there are lots of different things we could do.    Host: Very interesting, future science and pushing the limits of the technology. Now, Julie, from your end, I'm, I'm assuming you are also planning for this, right? You have your science objectives, and you're, you're going to be doing your best to get as much as you can on the first try, but beyond that what are you thinking about, not only in terms of analyzing that, that, data that you're getting on the initial run, but thinking about future opportunities as well?   Julie Castillo-Rogez: Yeah. I'm for pushing the limits of technology, actually; I'd be very curious to see, you know, how far we can go with the sail. There is a unique opportunity there because, I mean the more we learn about navigating a solar sail, you know, the better we are prepared for future missions, using that kind of propulsion system for deep space exploration. So that would be my preference. Of course, I mean, we are responsive to another sponsor, and so it would depend also on what another wants to do with the spacecraft, but we would come with a bunch of options. And I think that pushing the boundaries of technology is very important.    Host: Julie, in this moment, we're only, you know, we're, we're very close to actually launching this thing. How, how are you feeling? Do you feel prepared, do you feel excited that this is, this is right around the corner? We're very, very close.    Julie Castillo-Rogez: Yeah. [Laughter] So, that is a fantastic question because we were supposed to launch in December 2017. And as you know the, Artemis I launch has been delayed. And that is, that has been very beneficial to us because we've had more time to prepare. And now, I mean, it's, as you said, it's right around the corner and we are getting a little bit excited about the imminent launch. We are in the process of closing, you know, some, our requirements and making sure that everything is covered, and we are going to have a big review with our, another sponsor to, to make sure that we are ready for operations. And, and as Les noted, I really want to emphasize that we have a fantastic team. The team is absolutely extraordinary. It's been a privilege to work with that group and, you know, they're really on top of things and making sure that we are going to have a successful mission. And so, yeah, we are excited for sure. And actually, I can't wait for the launch sometime this spring year.    Host: Very exciting, and, and Les I'll, I'll end with this, the same question to you. You have been working very hard on this for a while, and you've already thought about, you know, what you have to do, and then even beyond; how are you feeling in this moment with, with launch right around the corner?    Les Johnson: Well, I'm extremely nervous. [Laughter] There's a lot riding on this. We've spent years working on the sail and the technology. As Julie mentioned, we were originally supposed to fly much sooner, and this particular flight sail has been packaged onto its spool for several years now. And I'm, I get a bit nervous when things are in storage that long, right? And, and you're going to do such a complex system, for the first time ever; there are going to be, what we call unknown unknowns, which, which are things that you had no clue were going to happen, that you have to in real time respond to and, and fix, and I expect that we will have a lot of surprises but we've got a really smart team and, a pretty robust little spacecraft that we ought to be able to deal with that. So I'm just nervous. We've got a lot to do. We're doing something for the first time ever and I fully expect it will not go as planned, initially, and we'll have to figure out how to solve problems that we haven't even foreseen, but if any team can do it, this team can do it.    Host: Well. I certainly appreciate the confidence and, and I'm just wishing all your teams the best of luck coming up here and, because, you know, it might just, as you're saying the unknown unknowns, it might take just a bit of that, but the preparation surely help, surely helps. And what you guys are doing is just so cool, talking about sailing the cosmos and studying asteroids -- it just doesn't get any better than that.

WISE obtained the images used to create this view over a period of about a day around May 17, 2010, during which it observed the asteroid four times.  Because WISE (renamed NEOWISE in 2013) is an infrared telescope, it senses heat from asteroids. Euphrosyne is quite dark in visible light, but glows brightly at infrared wavelengths.  This view is a composite of images taken at four different infrared wavelengths: 3.4 microns (color-coded blue), 4.6 microns (cyan), 12 microns (green) and 22 microns (red).  The moving asteroid appears as a string of red dots because it is much cooler than the distant background stars. Stars have temperatures in the thousands of degrees, but the asteroid is cooler than room temperature. Thus the stars are represented by shorter wavelength (hotter) blue colors in this view, while the asteroid is shown in longer wavelength (cooler) reddish colors.  The WISE spacecraft was put into hibernation in 2011 upon completing its goal of surveying the entire sky in infrared light. WISE cataloged three quarters of a billion objects, including asteroids, stars and galaxies. In August 2013, NASA decided to reinstate the spacecraft on a mission to find and characterize more asteroids.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19645"

                      "description": "This collage of radar images of near-Earth asteroid 1999 JD6 was collected by NASA scientists on July 25, 2015. The images show the rotation of the asteroid, which made its closest approach on July 24 at 9:55 p.m. PDT (12:55 a.m. EDT on July 25) at a distance of about 4.5 million miles (7.2 million kilometers, or about 19 times the distance from Earth to the moon).  The asteroid appears to be a contact binary -- an asteroid with two lobes that are stuck together.  These views, which are radar echoes, were obtained by pairing NASA's 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, with the 330-foot (100-meter) National Science Foundation Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Using this approach, the Goldstone antenna beams a radar signal at an asteroid and Green Bank receives the reflections. The technique, referred to as a bistatic observation, dramatically improves the amount of detail that can be seen in radar images. The new views obtained with the technique show features as small as about 25 feet (7.5 meters) wide.  The images show the asteroid is highly elongated, with a length of approximately 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) on its long axis.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19647"

                      "description": "On March 21, 2021, the large asteroid 2001 FO32 made a close approach with our planet, passing at a distance of about 1.25 million miles (2 million kilometers) — or 5 1/4 times the distance from Earth to the Moon. While there was no risk of the near-Earth asteroid colliding with Earth as its orbit is very well known, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California took the opportunity to capture these radar images of the asteroid as it tumbled past.      Using NASA's 34-meter (111.5-feet) Deep Space Station 13 (DSS-13) radio antenna at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Deep Space Communication Complex near Barstow, California, radio signals were transmitted to 2001 FO32. The signals then bounced off the surface of the asteroid and were received by the 100-meter (328-feet) Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Such radar observations can offer additional insight into the asteroid's orbit, provide a better estimate of its dimensions and rotation rate, and help glimpse surface features (like large boulders or craters).      Other radar observations were carried out by scientists using the 34-meter DSS-43 antenna at the Deep Space Network's Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex in Australia. Along with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Australia Telescope Compact Array near Narrabri in New South Wales, both antennas worked together to track 2001 FO32.      Asteroid 2001 FO32 was discovered in March 2001 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program in Socorro, New Mexico, and had been estimated, based on optical measurements, to be roughly 3,000 feet (1 kilometer) wide. In more recent follow-up observations by NEOWISE, 2001 FO32 appears to be faint when observed in infrared wavelengths, which suggests the object is likely less than 1 kilometer in diameter. Analysis by the NEOWISE team shows that it is between 1,300 to 2,230 feet (440 to 680 meters) wide. Further analysis of data from the radar campaign will better refine the size of the asteroid and increase the precision of its orbital calculations.

Prior to arriving at Bennu, mission planners had expected the asteroid’s surface to consist largely of fine particulate material, similar to gravel. When OSIRIS-REx arrived in December 2018, however, it was greeted by a rocky world covered with boulders.  This unexpected ruggedness means that there are few places on Bennu where OSIRIS-REx can safely touch down and collect a sample. After a year of studying the asteroid, the mission announced a primary sample collection site, which they designated “Nightingale,” along with a backup site called “Osprey.” In October 2020, OSIRIS-REx will descend to Bennu and attempt to collect up to four-and-a-half pounds of loose material, for return to Earth in 2023.

Sample site Nightingale, the mission’s targeted touch down spot, is only a few parking spaces wide and surrounded by building-sized boulders that pose a hazard to OSIRIS-REx. The spacecraft will carefully navigate down to the sample site with its sampling arm extended and touch Bennu’s surface for several seconds. Upon contact, the collector head will fire a bottle of nitrogen gas to agitate loose material, which is then caught in the spacecraft’s collector head. After this brief touch, OSIRIS-REx will fire its thrusters to back away from Bennu, navigating to a safe distance from the asteroid. The spacecraft will depart Bennu in 2021 and deliver the sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023.",

                      "description": "These images and animation represent NASA radar observations of 4660 Nereus on Dec. 10, 2021, before the asteroid's close approach on Dec. 11, when it came within 2.5 million miles (4 million kilometers) of Earth. Using the 70-meter radio antenna at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex near Barstow, California, scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory acquired the most detailed radar images of the nearly 1,100-foot-wide (330-meter-wide) near-Earth asteroid since its discovery almost four decades earlier. Nereus' orbit is very well known and the asteroid does not pose a threat to Earth.  During the asteroid's close approach, an image resolution of about 12.3 feet (3.75 meters) per pixel was possible, revealing surface features such as potential boulders and craters, plus ridges and other topography. Asteroid Nereus' previous approach in 2002 was near enough to Earth to reveal the asteroid's size and overall shape, but too distant to show surface features. The new observations will also help scientists better understand the asteroid's shape and rotation while providing them new data to further refine its orbital path around the Sun.  Nereus belongs to the relatively rare E-type asteroid family that exhibits very unusual radar scattering properties. It's thought that this may be caused by asteroids of this type having particularly rough terrain. Also, E-type asteroids are optically bright, sometimes reflecting as much as 50% of the sunlight that hits their surface. Typical S-type asteroids reflect about 15%, whereas dark C-type asteroids reflect only a few percent. It's thought that E-class asteroids may be the source of very rare Aubrite meteorites and are composed of comparatively bright material.  The 2021 close approach was the best opportunity for radar imaging of Nereus until 2060, when the asteroid will approach within 750,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) of Earth, only three times the Earth-Moon distance. At that time, Nereus will be an easy target for small telescopes and possibly even powerful binoculars.  Nereus – named after a sea god from Greek mythology – was discovered in 1982 by Eleanor \"Glo\" Helin as part of the JPL Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey.

Asteroid 2015 TB145 is depicted in eight individual radar images collected on Oct. 31, 2015 between 5:55 a.m. PDT (8:55 a.m. EDT) and 6:08 a.m. PDT (9:08 a.m. EDT). At the time the radar images were taken, the asteroid was between 440,000 miles (710,000 kilometers) and about 430,000 miles (690,000 kilometers) distant. Asteroid 2015 TB145 safely flew past Earth on Oct. 31, at 10:00 a.m. PDT (1 p.m. EDT) at about 1.3 lunar distances (300,000 miles, 480,000 kilometers).  To obtain the radar images, the scientists used the 230-foot (70-meter) DSS-14 antenna at Goldstone, California, to transmit high power microwaves toward the asteroid. The signal bounced of the asteroid, and their radar echoes were received by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's 100-meter (330-foot) Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. The images achieve a spatial resolution of about 13 feet (4 meters) per pixel.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20043"

                      "description": "This frame from a movie made from radar images of asteroid 1999 JD6 was collected by NASA scientists on July 25, 2015. The images show the rotation of the asteroid, which made its closest approach on July 24 at 9:55 p.m. PDT (12:55 a.m. EDT on July 25) at a distance of about 4.5 million miles (7.2 million kilometers, or about 19 times the distance from Earth to the moon).  The asteroid appears to be a contact binary -- an asteroid with two lobes that are stuck together. The radar images show the asteroid is highly elongated, with a length of approximately 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) on its long axis.  These images are radar echoes, which are more like a sonogram than a photograph. The views were obtained by pairing NASA's 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, with the 330-foot (100-meter) National Science Foundation Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Using this approach, the Goldstone antenna beams a radar signal at an asteroid and Green Bank receives the reflections. The technique, referred to as a bistatic observation, dramatically improves the amount of detail that can be seen in radar images. The new views obtained with the technique show features as small as about 25 feet (7.5 meters) wide.   http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19646"

                      "description": "Scientists using two giant, Earth-based radio telescopes bounced radar signals off passing asteroid 2011 UW158 to create images for this animation showing the rocky body's fast rotation.  The passing asteroid made its closest approach to Earth on July 19, 2015 at 7:37 a.m. PST (4:37 a.m. EST) at a distance of about 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers, or 6 times the distance from Earth to the moon). The close proximity during the pass made 2011 UW158 one of the best asteroid flybys of 2015 for imaging from Earth using radar.  The radar images reveal that the shape of the asteroid is extremely irregular and quite elongated. Prominent parallel, linear features run along the length of the object that cause a large increase in brightness of the radar images as they rotate into view.  Scientists note that the asteroid appears to be fairly unusual. Its fast rotation suggests the object has greater mechanical strength than other asteroids its size. A fast-rotating asteroid with lower mechanical strength would tend to split apart.  To obtain the views, researchers paired the 230-foot- (70-meter-) wide Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, in concert with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's 330-foot (100-meter) Green Bank Telescope. Using this technique, the Goldstone antenna beams a radar signal at an asteroid and Green Bank receives the reflections. The technique, referred to as a bi-static observation, dramatically improves the amount of detail that can be seen in radar images. The new views obtained with the technique show features as small as about 24 feet (7.5 meters) wide.  The 171 individual images used in the movie were generated from data collected on July 18. They show the asteroid is approximately 2000 by 1000 feet (600 by 300 meters) across. The observations also confirm earlier estimates by astronomers that the asteroid rotates quickly, completing one spin in just over half an hour. The movie spans a period of about an hour and 45 minutes.  The trajectory of asteroid 2011 UW158 is well understood. This flyby was the closest approach the asteroid will make to Earth for at least the next 93 years.  Asteroid 2011 UW158 was discovered on October 25, 2011, by the PanSTARRS 1 telescope, located on the summit of Haleakala on Maui, Hawaii. Managed by the University of Hawaii, the PanSTARRS survey receives NASA funding.  Radar is a powerful technique for studying an asteroid's size, shape, rotation state, surface features and surface roughness, and for improving the calculation of asteroid orbits. Radar measurements of asteroid distances and velocities often enable computation of asteroid orbits much further into the future than if radar observations weren't available.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19644"

The animation emphasizes the four largest particle-ejection events detected at Bennu between December 2018 and September 2019. Additional particles not related to the ejections are also visible.  Most of these pebble-size pieces of rock, typically measuring around a quarter inch (7 millimeters), were pulled back to Bennu under the asteroid's weak gravity after a short hop, sometimes even ricocheting back into space after colliding with the surface. Others remained in orbit for a few days and up to 16 revolutions. And some were ejected with enough force to completely escape from the Bennu environs.  OSIRIS-REx — which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer — arrived at Bennu in December 2018. On Oct. 20, 2020, the mission will attempt to briefly touch down on the asteroid to scoop up material likely to include particles that were ejected before dropping back to the surface.  If all goes as planned, the spacecraft will return to Earth in September 2023 with a cache of Bennu's particles for further study, including of which may even hold the physical clues as to what ejection mechanisms are at play.

The asteroid previous appellation was 2010 ML48.   The International Astronomical Union (IAU) renamed the asteroid as the request of Amy Mainzer of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. Mainzer is the principal investigator of NASA's NEOWISE space telescope. The IAU is the sole worldwide organization recognized by astronomers everywhere to designate names for astronomical bodies. So far, Mainzer and the NEOWISE team have focused on pioneers in civil rights, science and the arts for the astronomical honor. Among the strong women of history who have already had NEOWISE-discovered asteroids named for them are civil rights activist Rosa Parks, conservationist Wangari Maathai, abolitionists Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman, and singer Aretha Franklin.  Asteroid Malala is in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter and orbits the sun every five-and-a-half years. It is about two-and-a-half miles (four kilometers) in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19362"

Using the 70-meter (230-foot) Deep Space Station 14 antenna at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Deep Space Complex near Barstow, California, considerable detail in the asteroid's surface was revealed, including ridges, small hills, flat areas, concavities, and possible boulders. In addition, the radar observations of 2016 AJ193 confirmed that it is about three-quarters-of-a-mile (1.3-kilometers) wide. This series of images show the asteroid rotate (with a period of 3.5 hours) as each radar observation was made.  2016 AJ193 is the 1,001st asteroid to be observed by planetary radar, making its close approach with Earth only seven days after the 1,000th NEA to be observed by radar – asteroid 2021 PJ1, which measures between 65 and 100 feet (20 and 30 meters) wide – approached Earth at a distance of 1 million miles (about 1.7 million kilometers).  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24564",

Fortunately, asteroids like Bennu preserve the solar system’s earliest ingredients, including the carbon-based building blocks of life. That’s why NASA is sending a spacecraft called OSIRIS-REx to explore asteroid Bennu and bring a sample back to Earth. The material collected by OSIRIS-REx will provide a wealth of data for future generations of astrobiologists, shedding light on one of Earth’s biggest mysteries.",

Scientists had expected Bennu’s surface to consist of fine-grained material like a sandy beach, but were instead greeted by a rugged world littered with boulders – the size of cars, the size of houses, the size of football fields. Now, thanks to laser altimetry data and high-resolution imagery from OSIRIS-REx, we can take a tour of Bennu’s remarkable terrain.

DART viajará millones de kilómetros de forma autónoma antes de impactar deliberadamente contra Dimorphos, un pequeño asteroide que gira en torno a uno más grande llamado Didymos, con el objetivo de alterar ligeramente su órbita.

Being only 65 to 100 feet (20 to 30 meters) wide, asteroid 2021 PJ1 was too small to be imaged in any detail, but the powerful 70-meter (230-foot) Deep Space Station 14 (DSS-14) antenna at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Deep Space Complex near Barstow, California, was able to measure the Doppler frequency of the radio waves that reflected off the object's surface. The data was recorded for 16 minutes between 2:26 p.m. and 2:42 p.m. PDT on Aug. 14, 2021.      The figure shows radar echo signal strength on the vertical axis versus Doppler frequency (in units of hertz, or Hz) on the horizontal axis. The strong spike at a value of minus 70 Hz is the reflected signal (or \"echo\") from 2021 PJ1; the other, smaller spikes are receiver noise, which is like the static on an AM radio if there aren't any nearby stations.      Using this information, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California could more accurately calculate the asteroid's velocity, its distance from Earth and its future motion around the Sun.      These observations used a prediction – known as an \"ephemeris\" – that had relatively large uncertainties because the asteroid had been discovered only a few days earlier. If the original prediction had been perfect, the radar echo would appear at zero Hz. The fact that the radar echo is at minus 70 Hz indicates a correction could be made to the predicted velocity of minus 2.7 miles per hour (minus 1.2 meters per second). This measurement also reduced the uncertainty in the asteroid's distance from Earth from 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers) to 5.2 miles (8.3 kilometers) – a reduction of a factor of about 250.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24563",

More info: Asteroid Redirect Mission Update – On Sept. 14, 2016, NASA provided an update on the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) and how it contributes to the agency’s journey to Mars and protection of Earth. The presentation took place in the Robotic Operations Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Dr. John P. Holdren, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and NASA’s ARM Program Director, Dr. Michele Gates discussed the latest update regarding the mission. They explained the mission’s scientific and technological benefits and how ARM will demonstrate technology for defending Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids.

NASA will launch the Restore-L servicer in 2020 to refuel a live satellite and demonstrate that a suite of satellite-servicing technologies are operational.  More info: Asteroid Redirect Mission Update – On Sept. 14, 2016, NASA provided an update on the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) and how it contributes to the agency’s journey to Mars and protection of Earth. The presentation took place in the Robotic Operations Center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Dr. John P. Holdren, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and NASA’s ARM Program Director, Dr. Michele Gates discussed the latest update regarding the mission. They explained the mission’s scientific and technological benefits and how ARM will demonstrate technology for defending Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids. The briefing aired live on NASA TV and the agency’s website. For more information about ARM go to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/arm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nasa.gov/arm</a>.

Asteroid 2006 HV5 was discovered by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program in New Mexico in April 2006. The radar images show that 2006 HV5 is about 1,000 feet (300 meters) across, roughly the height of the Eiffel Tower, confirming size estimates derived from infrared observations made previously by NASA's NEOWISE mission. 2006 HV5 is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid as its orbit brings it close to Earth, but its path around the Sun is very well known and the asteroid is not an impact risk to our planet. Asteroids of this size come this close to Earth roughly once a year, on average.  The new observations were made by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory using the powerful 230-foot (70-meter) Goldstone Solar System Radar antenna at the Deep Space Network's facility near Barstow, California. The images confirm the asteroid's size, while also providing a detailed look at its meatball-like shape.  The asteroid has a rounded appearance, is \"squished\" at the poles (i.e., it is oblate), and has a rotation period of about 3.6 hours. The sequence of radar images spans slightly more than one rotation. The images, which have a resolution of about 12 feet (3.75 meters) per pixel, reveal surface features such as ridges, flat regions, concavities, and small-scale topography that might indicate boulders.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25834",

The spacecraft will intentionally crash itself into an asteroid to see if it can move its motion in space. If it does, this could be proved as a viable way to deflect a threatening asteroid in the future, should one be discovered.    DART is a spacecraft designed to impact an asteroid as a test of technology. DART’s target asteroid is NOT a threat to Earth. This asteroid system is a perfect testing ground to see if intentionally crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid is an effective way to change its course, should an Earth-threatening asteroid be discovered in the future."

The 70-meter radio antenna at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex near Barstow, California, and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia used radar to precisely track Apophis' motion. At the time of these observations, Apophis was about 10.6 million miles (17 million kilometers) from Earth, and each pixel has a resolution of 127 feet (38.75 meters).  These observations helped scientists of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, precisely determine the 1,100-feet-wide (340-meter-wide) asteroid's orbit around the Sun, ruling out any Earth impact threat for the next hundred years or more. As a result of these observations, Apophis was removed from the Sentry Impact Risk Table. The radar team will continue to analyze these observations to determine more information about Apophis' size, shape, and rate of spin.  Relying on optical telescopes and ground-based radar to help characterize every near-Earth object's orbit to improve long-term hazard assessments, CNEOS computes high-precision orbits in support of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA24168"

Unfortunately, a phenomenon called the Yarkovsky effect can make these predictions difficult over long time periods. How does this effect work? When sunlight strikes a rotating asteroid, the dayside heats up; as the asteroid turns, the night side cools and releases the heat, exerting a small thrust that can change the asteroid's direction over time. In order to learn more about this process on asteroid Bennu, NASA is sending a spacecraft called OSIRIS-REx to make detailed observations of Bennu's shape, brightness, and surface features. These factors are thought to influence the Yarkovsky effect, and understanding how will enable scientists to better predict the orbit of Bennu and other near-Earth asteroids.",

The potentially hazardous asteroid came within 2.5 million miles (4 million kilometers) of our planet, or 10.5 times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory used the 230-foot (70-meter) radio antenna at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex near Barstow, California, to precisely track the asteroid's motion and obtain detailed radar images.  1989 JA is a binary system, consisting of a large asteroid and a significantly smaller satellite asteroid that revolve around each other without touching. The larger asteroid is about 0.4 miles (700 meters) across and shows several topographic features as it rotates. The secondary asteroid, which was discovered this year, is between 100 and 200 meters in diameter and has an orbital period of about 17 hours.  1989 JA was discovered by Eleanor F. Helin at Palomar Observatory in Southern California on May 1, 1989. Follow-up radar observations that year did not reveal a satellite. In 2010, NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was used to help determine the primary asteroid's size. This year, a few weeks before the asteroid's most recent close approach, astronomers at Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic measured the asteroid's light curve (the change in reflected light intensity over time) and found hints of the satellite in orbit. The new Goldstone observations refined the size of 1989 JA and established that it is a binary system.  1989 JA does not currently pose an impact risk to Earth, but observations by planetary radar can help astronomers better understand its orbit around the Sun so that any future risk can be continually assessed.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25251",

DART's target asteroid is the moonlet Dimorphos, which orbits the larger asteroid Didymos; the pair are not a threat to Earth. This asteroid system will be a testing ground to see if intentionally crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid is an effective way to change its course, should an Earth-threatening asteroid be discovered in the future.      The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, manages the DART mission for NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office as a project of the agency's Planetary Missions Program Office. DART is the world's first planetary defense test mission, intentionally executing a kinetic impact into Dimorphos to slightly change its motion in space. While the asteroid does not pose any threat to Earth, the DART mission will demonstrate that a spacecraft can autonomously navigate to a kinetic impact on a relatively small asteroid and prove this is a viable technique to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth if one is ever discovered. DART will reach its target on Sept. 26, 2022.  https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA25329",

When the observations began 2014 JO25 was 1.53 million miles (2.47 million kilometers) from Earth. By the time the observations concluded, the asteroid was 1.61 million miles (2.59 million kilometers) away.  The asteroid has a contact binary structure -- two lobes connected by a neck-like region. The largest of the asteroid's two lobes is estimated to be 2,000 feet (610 meters) across.  Asteroid 2014 JO25 approached to within 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) of Earth on April 19. There are no future flybys by 2014 JO25 as close as this one for more than 400 years.  The resolution of the radar images is about 25 feet (7.5 meters) per pixel. 154 images were used to create a movie.  The movie can be seen at. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21597"

This major validation, however, was accompanied by a major surprise. Scientists had expected Bennu’s surface to consist of fine-grained material like a sandy beach, but instead OSIRIS-REx was greeted by a rugged world littered with boulders – the size of cars, the size of houses, the size of football fields.  The main science goal of OSIRIS-REx is to briefly touch down on Bennu and collect a sample for return to Earth, but the asteroid’s unexpected roughness could pose a hazard to the spacecraft. Areas for safely touching down are fewer and smaller than anticipated, and OSIRIS-REx will have to navigate to them with unprecedented accuracy.  The 3D animations on this page were created using laser altimetry data and imagery of Bennu taken by OSIRIS-REx.",
